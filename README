A keymap for Ukrainian (UTF-8).

The "Ukrainian enhanced keymap" simply allows you typing Ukrainian in Vim using jcuken Windows layout.
There is another ukrainian layout already in Vim. See keymap\ukrainian-jcuken.vim script by Anatoli Sakhnik. But this one differs in way it maps numeric keys. It uses values usual for Windows users.

I use this in my vimrc file:
" Ukrainian support
"set keymap=ukrainian-enhanced
" Default - latin layout
"set iminsert=0
" Default - latin layout in search mode
"set imsearch=0
